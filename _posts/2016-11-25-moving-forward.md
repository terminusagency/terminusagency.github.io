So it looks like the best article to move forward with is Jonathon McGlone's [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) and the [Jekyll docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

One of the major points of interest is also integrating Jekyll with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/_)!
